# Suckless Tools Configration :
<p> this repo contain my configration for 
    suckless tools (dwm,st,dmenu,...etc) ,
    It has some helping scripts .
    << Tested On Debian 12 >>
</p>
### Characteristics
-   it is configured with pipewire audio server 
-   it uses conky for cpu , ram , and swap
-   I have written my python status text for dwm
   -- Note : I have ignored the scripts/statusbar/pythonvenv directory contents
   -- Because it can be generated with command
   ``` python
   python3 -m venv scripts/statusbar/pythonvenv
   ```
